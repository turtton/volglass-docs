Current issue that the way to publish documents in obsidian.

1. Sync between obsdian files and GitHub Repository
2. Conversion and parsing of Markdown files (handled by volglass).
3. Publishing the generated files.

There are various methods available for steps 1 and 3, which I believed were beyond the scope of volglass support. However, I realized that it is necessary to provide examples so that users know how to proceed.

Regarding step 1: 
I wanted to achieve real-time synchronization across multiple devices, so I'm using [Self-hosted livesync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync) and its associated filesync software. However, I know that this method is quite complex and not user-friendly for general users. 
I don't know of other synchronization methods, so I need to research and would appreciate it if you could let me know if you have any suggestions.  
[denolehov/obsidian-git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) might be helpful. I'll look into its behavior later. 
As a straightforward method, one can manage the Obsidian folder directly with Git, manually committing and pushing changes. However, I prefer to consider this as a last resort.

Regarding step 3: 
The simplest method would be to use GitHub Pages. However, it requires setting up a deployment workflow. Although GitHub Actions can be somewhat complex, I believe this issue can be resolved by providing a template repository.
I personally use Cloudflare Pages, and there are several reasons for this choice:
- It does not require complex workflows; you can select the target GitHub repository (including private ones) and enter three items to publish the documentation.
- It allows previewing web pages at the branch or commit level. I think that is better than GitHub Pages in terms of functionality.
- It offers access restrictions, such as email authentication, for web pages (Cloudflare Access).
- All these features are available for free.

Based on these factors, there is no reason not to use Cloudflare Pages. However, I understand that some people may have reservations about using a new service.

Vercel might also be a viable option, but I am not familiar with the service, so I need to research it. In particular, I need to confirm if Java is available in the build environment.
